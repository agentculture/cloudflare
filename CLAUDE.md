# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

CloudFlare management for the **AgentCulture OSS** organization, built as Claude Code **skills and subagents** ("ClaudeFlare"). Part of the Culture workspace (see `culture` CLI / <https://culture.dev>). Maintained jointly by agents and one human (Ori Nachum).

Parent workspace context lives in `../CLAUDE.md`. The global workspace uses uv for Python, but this repo is bash-based (see "Tooling choice" below).

## Current state

Phase 1 (read-only skills) is complete, and the first write-ops script (Single Redirect creation) has landed in a **separate skill** so read and write stay decoupled. See each skill's `SKILL.md` for user-facing docs (what each script does, when it runs, how to add new scripts).

Layout:

```

**Skills split:** `cloudflare` (read) and `cloudflare-write` (write) are discrete skills with separate discovery triggers so agents can't accidentally mutate state while answering an inventory question. Both share `_lib.sh` via symlink — fixes to the helpers apply to both. Write scripts default to dry-run and require `--apply` to actually POST/PUT/DELETE.

Pagination is transparent: `cf_api_paginated` in `_lib.sh` walks every page of a list endpoint so scripts see one aggregated `.result`. `shopt -s inherit_errexit` is enabled in `_lib.sh` so `exit 1` inside `cf_api` propagates through the `$(...)` layer `cf_api_paginated` adds — removing this breaks error-path tests silently.

## Hard constraints

- **Do not join the culture mesh from this repo.** Ori will signal when it's time. Until then, skills are invoked locally in Claude Code but must be designed as if a mesh peer will call them later: stable CLI interfaces, deterministic output, structured enough for another agent to parse.
- **Credentials never live in the repo.** The CloudFlare API token goes in a `.env` file at the repo root (gitignored). `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is the env var name; `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is also expected for account-scoped endpoints. `_lib.sh` loads `.env` on import with a safe `KEY=VALUE` parser — no `source`, no shell execution.
- **Ownership model:** CloudFlare responsibility is earned through work and can be split across multiple agents by domain or resource area. Skills must therefore be parameterized by zone/account — never hardcode `culture.dev` or a specific account ID in skill logic; take it as an arg or from env.

## Tooling choice

Bash + `curl` + `jq`, no runtime Python deps. Matches the house style in `culture/` and `citation-cli/`. `wrangler` CLI and the official SDK are acceptable for one-off needs, but skills should default to REST via `curl` for a uniform surface across DNS/Workers/Pages/account and to avoid stateful `wrangler login` under a dedicated agent user.

## Output conventions

- **Default:** markdown — tables for list data (pipe-delimited with `| --- |` separator rows), markdown key-value (`- **key:** value`) for single-object data. This is agent-readable, renders anywhere, and stays grep-able.
- **`--json` flag on every script:** raw API JSON passthrough for bots, scripts, and `jq` pipelines.

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1 — read-only skills** ✓ Done. All seven scripts (`cf-whoami`, `cf-zones`, `cf-dns`, `cf-workers`, `cf-workers-routes`, `cf-pages`, `cf-status`) plus pagination, CI, and docs.
2. **Phase 2 — write skill bootstrap + first redirect** ✓ In progress. Introduces the `cloudflare-write` skill and `cf-redirect-create.sh` (issue #2 — `agentculture.org → culture.dev`). Establishes the dry-run-by-default / `--apply`-to-commit safety pattern that all future `cf-*-create.sh` / `cf-*-update.sh` / `cf-*-delete.sh` scripts will follow.
3. **Phase 3 — `agentirc.dev` cleanup.** `agentirc.dev` is deprecated. Uses the inventory scripts (`cf-pages`, `cf-dns`, `cf-workers-routes`) as the audit trail, then deletes via new `cf-*-delete.sh` scripts in `cloudflare-write`.
4. **Later:** multi-domain support, mesh integration, expansion to R2 / Access / Zero Trust, and potentially mixed CloudFlare–AWS workflows.

## Conventions for adding code

- **Names, not IDs.** Scripts accept domain / project / script names and resolve to IDs internally (e.g. `cf-dns.sh culture.dev`, not a zone id). One extra API call is the price of ergonomics.
- **URL-encode any user-supplied argument** before interpolating into a URL (`jq -rn --arg v "$input" '$v|@uri'`).
- **Every list script uses `cf_api_paginated`.** Single-object endpoints (e.g. `/user/tokens/verify`) use `cf_api` directly.
- **Agent-readable default, `--json` opt-in.** Markdown tables for lists, markdown key-value for single objects, raw JSON only when explicitly requested.
- **Every new script ships with a bats file under `tests/bats/` and at least one fixture under `tests/fixtures/`.** CI runs them all on every PR.

## PR workflow

All work goes through a feature branch + PR + automated review cycle (qodo, Copilot, SonarCloud). The vendored `pr-review` skill at `.claude/skills/pr-review/` owns the details — read its `SKILL.md` for the full workflow. Four cheat-sheet points:

- **Before you start: pull latest `main` and fork the branch from there.**

  ```sh
  git fetch origin
  git switch main && git pull --ff-only
  git switch -c feat/<short-descriptive-name>
  ```

  Do this even if you think you're up to date. PRs in this repo squash-merge, which collapses their commits into a single new commit on `main`; any branch forked before that squash still carries the original commits and will hit spurious add/add conflicts on rebase. Starting fresh from the latest `main` avoids the whole class of problem.

- **After `gh pr create`, immediately invoke the `poll` skill.** It spawns a background subagent that watches the PR and notifies you only when both qodo and Copilot have finished. Cheaper than self-paced wakeups because the main session doesn't burn context on heartbeats. See `.claude/skills/poll/SKILL.md`.
- **Fetch ALL review feedback with one call:** `bash .claude/skills/pr-review/scripts/pr-comments.sh <PR>`. It returns inline comments, issue comments, top-level reviews, and SonarCloud new issues in a single pass — don't hand-roll `gh api` / `curl sonarcloud.io` calls.
- **Triage / reply / resolve** via the `pr-review` skill once the poll wakes you.

## Active design context

Live design decisions (scope, auth shape, skill layout, phase-1 targets) are tracked in `/home/spark/.claude/projects/-home-spark-git-cloudflare/memory/` — read `MEMORY.md` there at the start of a session if you need the current state of the conversation's working agreements.
